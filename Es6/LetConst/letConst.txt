The keyword "let" enables the users to define variables and on the other hand, "const" enables the users to define constants. 
Variables were previously declared using "var" which had function scope and were hoisted to the top.
 It means that a variable can be used before declaration. But, the "let" variables and constants have block scope which
 is surrounded by curly-braces "{}" and cannot be used before declaration.
