a promise is a good way to handle asynchronous operations.
// It is used to find out if the asynchronous operation is successfully completed or not.

//A promise may have one of three states.

* Pending
* Fulfilled
* Rejected

//A promise starts in a pending state. That means the process is not complete. If the operation is successful,
 the process ends in a fulfilled state. And, if an error occurs, the process ends in a rejected state.
