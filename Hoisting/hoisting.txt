Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

//In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
//Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.
